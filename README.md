### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The name's spewage. I'm a cybersecurity researcher from God-knows-where. I upload interesting projects I work on here, you can also find blog posts explaining what they are and how I use them on my website: <a href="https://spewage.lol">spewage.lol</a>

You can also contact me on Signal at: spewage19.84
<br>
Or on Telegram at: <a href="https://t.me/spewage">t.me/spewage</a>
<br>
I don't use Discord, WhatsApp or any other non-trustworthy IM platforms that obey the orders of federal agents. If you see anyone claiming to be me on platforms that are not Signal or Telegram, it's not me.

The only social media I use is Twitter. You can find me there at <a href="https://twitter.com/spewage14">@spewage14</a>

That's about all I have to say. I hope you have a good day :3
